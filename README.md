## GitHub Action Data Retriever

Hi everyone! This repository calls an API to download the real-time bike rental system data Velib. The language used is Python and the script is run each hour at 30 minutes each day during the whole month of December 2023 (hopefully). This whole process is run on a schedule using GitHub Actions. You can find more details on the API called in this project [here](https://www.velib-metropole.fr/donnees-open-data-gbfs-du-service-velib-metropole) and [here](https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/velib-disponibilite-en-temps-reel/information/).
